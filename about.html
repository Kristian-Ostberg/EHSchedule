              Hey! This is Stefan, creator of EHSchedule. This
              page just explains some information about the creation of this
              website. Feel free to read about some of the things I found
              interesting while building this schedule site!

          <div class="col-12 aboutText">
            <p>
              This was created as a project to see how I could combine
              Javascript and HTML, two coding languages I learned through the
              Computer Science magnet at Edgewater Highschool. I noticed that
              the class schedule posted on Edgewater's official website was not
              accurate to reflect changes made before the 2023-2024 school year
              started. I then started thinking about what might be useful to see
              on a small webpage made specifically for Edgewater's schedule. I
              threw it all together in a few days and now I have a super handy
              website to use when I want to know how much time is left in class!

              The base function of this website may be complete, but I still
              want to improve it in any way I can. I'm always open to

                Another suggestion change. On each schedule page, there's now a 
                countdown to the last day of school! This is counting down to the
                underclassmen's final day. Sorry seniors. You'll have to count 
                down to your graduation on your own.

                Speaking of graduation, it's sneaking up on me <i>very</i> fast!
                I was planning to try to figure out how to preserve this website 
                before I graduated, but I might have run out of time. I will try
                to find a way to keep this website up in some way, but unfortunately
                I can't make any promises.

                I know that in the previous changelog I said this website will no
                longer be maintained, but I figured I'd do one last update -- for 
                old time's sake, y'know? I've gotten a few suggestions to make the
                website show when we're in 10/10 (I think it's called "No Fly 
                Zone" or something now) so I decided to finally code that feature!

                New year, new site! Over the summer I have worked to create a 
                brand new website with more features and flexibility. As of 
                August 12, it is blocked by OCPS because it is a newly registered
                domain. However, once it is unblocked, all creative process and 
                attention will be shifted to my new site. This page will stay up 
                for the forseeable future, but it will no longer be updated.
